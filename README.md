# Model-Predictive-Control
This repository implements a Model-Predictive Controller for the modified four tank system in MATLAB. 
## Purpose
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is being used more and more in various areas of industry. Therefore, this project aims to give an introduction to modelling, MPC and its advantages. The problem considers the Modified Four Tank System and shows how to design a Model Predictive Control System
on this model. As a programming language MATLAB with Simulink and the optimization library CasADi was chosen.

## System 
An overview of the system is given by:

### Disclaimer
Some functions that are used come from a non open-source library. To run the project this library would need to be installed first.
